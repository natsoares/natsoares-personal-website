  <h4>Ian Borges</h4>

  <p>I designed Ian's personal brand and website. He needed a light and minimalistic brand that represents his spirit of passion and adventure as well as his nomad and balanced way of life. He is a lifestyle coach that helps you live a freedom and meaningful life.</p>

  <p>I created a visual identity that translates his characteristics into typography and colours. The graphics I used also represents his freedom style and a more tailored/unique way of life.</p>
