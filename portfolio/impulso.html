    <h2>Impulso Network</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Impulso Network is a platform with multiple functionalities for designers and developers where people can share knowledge, discuss topics, participate in virtual coworking and apply for remote positions, among other opportunities. When I started the UI  I focused on the users, which are mainly software developers. Initially I gathered datas of what users accessed the most, studied the flow from the website to the dashboard and highlighted all functionalities for easy access. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I created a clean, modern and technological interface, which are characteristics of the company I chose to represent to offer a comfortable environment for developers to access frequently . Based on that, I decided to embrace the dark/light mode trend that suited this layout and purpose very well. Always following the brand book guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Design System & Consistency</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm currently creating a Design System to facilitate the maintenance of style guides and visual consistency using Figma shared with all designers throughout the company.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I started a Design Chapter to keep our design guidelines up-to-date, so we always know new features and products that are being created - it allows us to collaborate faster and improve all products together.</p>

    <h2>Icons & Graphics</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">One of the things that I like to work on when designing user interfaces is create unique icons and illustrations to reinforce the brand's identity.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Impulso's brand book suggests using the popular and open source feather icon family - I also create new ones based on the same style when I need a specific representation to support the information.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-internal-col">
    <h2>Newsletter Design</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Since my responsibility is making sure all web projects are aligned with our design system and running smoothly, the newsletter is one of the projects I take care of in both matter of design and implementation.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">When the old newsletter version started to grow more complex with more blocks, gifs and images it was time to redesign. I decided to eliminate all unnecessary images and icons from the design and create a new HTML + CSS from scratch to make sure it won't clip.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The result was great. It doubled the open rate from 20% to 40%. It was a great achievement that could only be accomplished by teamwork.</p>
