  <h4>LEADWISE</h4>

  <p>I was responsible to design and develop every visual part of LeadWise projects.</p>
  <p>Here is a short description about the company: "We believe we need to CHANGE HOW WORK WORKS. People should look forward to going to work, and not the opposite. LeadWise is a home for business leaders to get practical tools and education to lead in todayâ€™s changing world."</p>
  <p>Based on LeadWise's values and goals, I designed a clean and modern visual focusing on their content.</p>
