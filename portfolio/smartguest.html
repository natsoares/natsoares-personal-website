    <h2>Design App Interface</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">SmartGuest started as an idea to improve experiences for guests in hotels. When I started to contribute by March 2020, the visual identity was already created, so I started designing interfaces and suggesting new ideas for user flows.</p>
    <p><b>My role</b>: I'm mainly responsible for creating the app interface as well as defining user flows and presenting  lo-fi and hi-fi app design.</p>
    <p><b>Team</b>: Me & LA Design</p>
    <p><b>Duration</b>: 4 months (March 2020 - Current)</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The app is currently in development to be deployed. My plans are to keep tracking of how users will interact with the app through email surveys and feedback from the app stores.</p>
    <p>I'm planning using the app myself in a hotel to experience its functionality from start to finish and improve with any insights I had from it and what I could collect from other guests.</p>
