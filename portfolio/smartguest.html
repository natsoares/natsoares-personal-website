    <h2>Design App Interface</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">SmartGuest started as an idea to improve experiences for guests in hotels. When I started to contribute by March 2020, the visual identity was already created, so I started designing interfaces and suggesting new ideas for user flows.</p>
    <p><b>My role</b>: I'm mainly responsible for creating the app interface as well as defining user flows and presenting  lo-fi and hi-fi app design.</p>
    <p><b>Team</b>: Me & LA Design</p>
    <p><b>Duration</b>: 4 months (March 2020 - Current)</p>

    <h2>The process</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Everyone involved had a clear idea of what the app should do: facilitate guest's check-ins and check-outs in hotels. The first screens defined to be designed for this app were Login, Reservations, Statement and Profile.</p>

    <h2>Icons & Graphics</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">One of the things that I like to work on when designing user interfaces is create unique icons and illustrations to reinforce the brand's identity.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I created icons to complement information, make it more understandable and easy to read.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Boleto Simples also needed to explain how they connect to other banks and process payment slip between the bank and other companies. So I illustrated the process.</p>
