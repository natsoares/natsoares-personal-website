    <h2>Redesigning the Public Ministry of the State</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Back in 2015 I worked for the Public Ministry of the State of Cear√°, Brazil. There were a lot of meetings to improve the prototype I created and to adjust the user's needs, specially developing for accessibility, one of the requirements for Public Ministry's website.</p>

    <h2>Design & Development</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Initially I researched the company needs for the new website, how they used it internally, what was difficult for them to proceed on their current website and what were the most popular categories searched by the users.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I came up with a solution for two very different targets: internal attorneys and civilians.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I created the layout applying their brand's guidelines and focusing on easier access of different services for the user.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This project took about six months from research to design and implementation. It was very intense and it is a memorable one. It was my first contact with accessibility for the web and learning the importance of creating something for everyone. It was also a relevant project that I lead working hard to make an improvement for both attorneys and civilians of my hometown. I'm proud that it's still being used.</p>
