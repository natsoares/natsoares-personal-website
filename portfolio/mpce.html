  <h4>MPCE</h4>

  <p>Back in 2015 I worked for the Public Ministry of the State as a Web Designer. I knew their need to redesign their website, so with a couple of months working for them, I made a research about their needs for the new website, how they used it internally and what were the most popular categories searched by our main users. I came up with a couple of personas, both the attorneys and the population in our state access this website for important information about this sector.</p>

  <p>I came up with a solution for two very different targets: internal attorneys and civilians. I redesigned their website based on this datas, there were a lot of meetings to improve the prototype I created and to adjust our user's needs, specially develop the accesibility, one of the requirements for Public Ministry's website.</p>

  <p>I created this layout appling their brand's guilines and focusing on easier access for different services they provide.</p>
