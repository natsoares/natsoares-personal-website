    <h2>Redesigning for Boleto Simples</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">I was responsible for the redesign of the Boleto Simples website. The objective was to create a new visual identity to represent it as a modern, trustful and stable financial company.</p>

    <h2>About Boleto Simples</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Boleto Simples helps other companies, such as e-commerces, to generate a brazilian payment method called "boleto", a payment slip, a paper for debt payments.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This paper can only be  generated by a bank so Boleto Simples intermediate this process in an easy and effective way between the bank and other companies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="portfolio-internal-col">
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Boleto Simples was using a Serif font on it's heading that was not connected to any other typography or element of the page. In order to reinforce the brand's identity, bring a more modern, light and yet solid message, I changed all title's typography to "Quicksand" that matches closer to the brand.</p>

    <h2>Icons & Graphics</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">One of the things that I like to work on when designing user interfaces is create unique icons and illustrations to reinforce the brand's identity.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I created icons to complement information, make it more understandable and easy to read.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Boleto Simples also needed to explain how they connect to other banks and process payment slip between the bank and other companies. So I illustrated the process.</p>
